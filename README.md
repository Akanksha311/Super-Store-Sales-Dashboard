Turning numbers into insights for better business decisions

# 2.What’s This Project About?
This dashboard was built to make sense of a Super Store’s sales data — turning raw numbers into something that decision-makers can actually use.

The main goal is To help businesses understand their sales performance quickly and clearly.

   4. Microsoft Excel – The starting point for the raw dataset
